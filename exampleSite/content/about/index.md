## Debug Tables

[hugo-debug-tables](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/hugo-debug-tables) is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) module / theme component that adds partials and a shortcode for displaying most variables available on pages generated by Hugo.
See [License](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/hugo-debug-tables/blob/master/LICENSE) for permissions for use.

### Modern Hugo Only (as of 2021-03-20)

This module is built using assumptions that may require Hugo 0.81.0 or higher, and in any event those are the only versions on which it has been tested, at present.

### Acknowledgements

Idea and initial HTML sources from

## Alternative Approaches

* [Hugo Debug Bar](https://github.com/JugglerX/hugo-debug-bar)
  * This looks interesting as it is an overlay over the page, and the variables are curated rather than an alphabetical full dump.
  * On the downside, it looks like more work to use this.
* [Hugo Debug Print](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-debugprint/)
* [David's Neighbour Org Debug Module](https://github.com/dnb-org/dnb-hugo-debug)
  * Adds debug to ``hugo`` run rather than embedded in the site.
